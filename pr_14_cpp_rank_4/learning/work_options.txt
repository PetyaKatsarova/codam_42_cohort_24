Tip:

Universities and research institutes in all three countries often hire C++ devs for PhD, research assistant, or project engineer positions (sometimes open to recent graduates).

Look for “Graduate Engineer,” “Junior Software Engineer,” or “Trainee Embedded Developer” in job titles.

Knowing German is a bonus for Austria, sometimes required.

Summary:
ASML, Philips, TTTech, AVL, Bosch, Frequentis—all reputable names. The Dutch and Austrian ecosystems are especially strong for C++ in robotics, automation, and scientific roles. Bulgaria’s opportunities are mostly in Sofia, with big names like Bosch and Mentor Graphics.
