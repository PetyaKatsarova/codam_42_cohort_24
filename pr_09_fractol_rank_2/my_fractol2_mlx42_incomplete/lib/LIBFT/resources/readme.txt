External functs. Detailed below
Libft authorized n/a
Description Write your own library: a collection of functions
that will be a useful tool for your cursus.
III.1 Technical considerations
• Declaring global variables is forbidden.
• If you need helper functions to split a more complex function, define them as static
functions. This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file.
• Place all your files at the root of your repository.
• Turning in unused files is forbidden.
• Every .c files must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
• You must use the command ar to create your library. Using the libtool command
is forbidden.
• Your libft.a has to be created at the root of your repository.

 Part 1 - Libc functions
To begin, you must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the
same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They
will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.
Some of the functions’ prototypes you have to redo use the ’restrict’
qualifier. This keyword is part of the c99 standard. It is
therefore forbidden to include it in your own prototypes and to
compile your code with the -std=c99 flag.
You must write your own function implementing the following original ones. They do
not require any external functions:
• isalpha
• isdigit
• isalnum
• isascii
• isprint
• strlen
• memset
• bzero
• memcpy
• memmove
• strlcpy
• strlcat
• toupper
• tolower
• strchr
• strrchr
• strncmp
• memchr
• memcmp
• strnstr
• atoi
In order to implement the two following functions, you will use malloc():
• calloc
• strdup

III.3 Part 2 - Additional functions
In this second part, you must develop a set of functions that are either not in the libc,
or that are part of it but in a different form.
Some of the following functions can be useful for writing the
functions of Part 1.

descriptor.

Chapter IV
Bonus part
If you completed the mandatory part, do not hesitate to go further by doing this extra
one. It will bring bonus points if passed successfully.
Functions to manipulate memory and strings is very useful. But you will soon discover
that manipulating lists is even more useful.
You have to use the following structure to represent a node of your list. Add its
declaration to your libft.h file:
typedef struct s_list
{
void *content;
struct s_list *next;
} t_list;
The members of the t_list struct are:
• content: The data contained in the node.
void * allows to store any kind of data.
• next: The address of the next node, or NULL if the next node is the last one.
In your Makefile, add a make bonus rule to add the bonus functions to your libft.a.
The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is
PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done
and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the
mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.
