A thread is a lightweight execution unit inside a process. Multiple threads in one process share memory (code/data), but each has its own stack.
Use threads to:
Do tasks in parallel (on multi-core CPUs)
Keep your program responsive (e.g., UI + background work)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void* say_hello(void* arg) {
    printf("Hello from thread!\n");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    pthread_create(&tid, NULL, say_hello, NULL);
    pthread_join(tid, NULL);
    return 0;
}
pthread_create starts a thread.
pthread_join waits for it to finish.

cc -pthread thread.c && ./a.out
=================================================
int id = *(int*)arg;
This line has two steps:

🔹 1. (int*)arg
This casts the void* to an int*.
arg is declared as void* in void* function(void* arg)
A void* can’t be directly dereferenced — we must cast it to the correct pointer type first
(int*)arg  → pointer to int
🔹 2. *(int*)arg
This dereferences the pointer to get the actual int value.
arg → pointer to int
* → get the value it points to
=========================================================
What is Clang?
Clang is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler — a modern alternative to GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
Key Points:
Developed as part of LLVM project
Very fast and modular
Gives clearer error messages than GCC
Often used with static analyzers, code formatters, and sanitizers
===========================================================================
int xi = (int)x;               // Warning: casting pointer to int
(void *)(i + 1);               // Warning: casting int to pointer
You're abusing pointer types to pass/receive integers, which is:
non-portable
leads to undefined behavior
triggers warnings because int (4 bytes) ≠ void * (8 bytes on 64-bit)

intptr_t is an integer type that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold a pointer safely.
defined in : #include <stdint.h>
Why use intptr_t?
You can't safely cast between void * and int directly on 64-bit systems because:

void * = 8 bytes
int = 4 bytes
leads to warnings and data loss
So you use intptr_t to bridge them safely
====================================================================
A mutex (mutual exlusion) allows us to encapsulate blocks of code that should only be executed in one thread at a time. Put another way, it allows us to glue together a sequence of operations that would otherwise not be atomic, so that they are executed atomically. Put yet another way, it allows us to be certain that the intermediate state during a sequence of operations will not be observed or tampered with by another thread.
