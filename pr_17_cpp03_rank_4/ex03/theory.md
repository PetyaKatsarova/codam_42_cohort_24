class A {
public:
    std::string name;
};

class B : public A { };
class C : public A { };

// D inherits from both B and C
class D : public B, public C { };
Now, D has two copies of A: one from B, one from C.
So this is ambiguous:

D obj;
obj.name = "value"; // Error: which A::name? From B or from C?
================================
If you declare:

class B : virtual public A { };
class C : virtual public A { };
class D : public B, public C { };
Then C++ will make sure that only one A exists in D.
==================================
class A {
public:
    std::string name;
};

class B : virtual public A { };
class C : virtual public A { };

class D : public B, public C {
public:
    void test() {
        name = "D"; //  OK! Only one A exists
    }
};
===================
DiamondTrap::DiamondTrap(std::string name)
    : ClapTrap(name + "_clap_name"), ScavTrap(), FragTrap(), name(name)
You explicitly initialize the shared ClapTrap once.
====================
You're building a DiamondTrap that:

Inherits from ScavTrap and FragTrap

Both of them inherit from ClapTrap

You must:

Set a special name for ClapTrap (name + "_clap_name")

Set your own private name (DiamondTrap::name)

Get correct HP/EP/AD values from Frag/Scav

Avoid duplicate ClapTraps using virtual inheritance

ClapTrap(name + "_clap_name")
You must manually call the ClapTrap constructor, because:

You’re using virtual inheritance → C++ makes you responsible for calling it.

You give it a name like "Bob_clap_name"

This sets ClapTrap::name, which is used internally (e.g., in attacks)
ClapTrap::name = "Bob_clap_name";
ScavTrap() and FragTrap()
Why do you call these?

Because:

You inherit from both

They initialize:

ScavTrap → energyPoints = 50

FragTrap → hitPoints = 100, attackDamage = 30

Their constructors also:

Call the default ClapTrap() — but you override that by calling ClapTrap(name + "_clap_name") directly in DiamondTrap
his sets the private member of DiamondTrap:

private:
    std::string name;
now we have:
DiamondTrap::name = "Bob"
ClapTrap::name = "Bob_clap_name"
=========================class A {
public:
    A() { std::cout << "A\n"; }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B() { std::cout << "B\n"; }
};
Then:

B b;
calls:

A()
B()
So yes, base constructors are called automatically if you don’t specify them.

In multiple inheritance with virtual bases:
When you use virtual inheritance:

cpp
Copy code
class A { public: A(std::string) { } };
class B : virtual public A { };
class C : virtual public A { };
class D : public B, public C {
public:
    D(std::string s) : A(s), B(), C() { }
};
You must call A(s) yourself in D’s constructor.

Otherwise, the compiler will complain: "no matching constructor for A".

So:
 ScavTrap() and FragTrap() are optional (default will be called)

 ClapTrap(...) must be called explicitly when it’s a virtual base
 Why explicitly call ScavTrap() and FragTrap() in DiamondTrap?
Even though C++ would call their default constructors automatically, you do it explicitly to show:

Clarity (you know what’s happening)

You might later want to pass a custom name or log something

You follow the subject's expectation to control how inheritance works

 Final Answer
| Do you need to call ScavTrap() and FragTrap()? |  No (default gets called) |
| Should you explicitly call them? |  Yes (for clarity & control) |
| Do you have to call ClapTrap(...)? |  Yes — because of virtual inheritance |
