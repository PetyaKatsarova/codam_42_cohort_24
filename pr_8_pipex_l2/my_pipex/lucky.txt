I remember that wonderful instant:
You appeared before me,
Like a fleeting vision,
Like a spirit of pure beauty.

In the anguish of hopeless sadness,
In the worries of noisy bustle,
Your tender voice lingered in my heart,
Your dear features came to me in dreams.

The years passed. The storm's wild gusts
Dispersed my earlier dreams,
And I forgot your tender voice,
Your heavenly features.

In the solitude, in the darkness of confinement,
My days quietly dragged along,
Without divinity, without inspiration,
Without tears, without life, without love.

My soul awoke from its torpor,
And you appeared again,
Like a fleeting vision,
Like a spirit of pure beauty.

And my heart beat in rapture,
And once again revived,
Divinity, inspiration,
Life, tears, and love.
